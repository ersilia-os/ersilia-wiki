# Job Description

**Period:** Part time, 300h hours. Start date: March 2022\
**Type:** Contract position. Applicants must be able to work legally in their country. Honoraries to be discussed on a per-application basis.

The Ersilia Open Source Initiative (EOSI; [https://ersilia.io](https://ersilia.io)) is seeking a dynamic, enthusiastic, and disciplined data scientist to deploy AI/ML models to the AWS Cloud. The position will involve bringing to production the current AI/ML models available in the Ersilia Model Hub, as well as adding a privacy-preserving component to them, based on the tools developed by OpenMined or similar recent initiatives. You will work closely with Dr. Miquel Duran-Frigola, Lead Scientist and Co-Founder of EOSI and main developer of the Ersilia Model Hub.&#x20;

The current position is sponsored by several grants awarded to EOSI, including the Merck BioPharma Speed Grant. EOSI is a UK-registered charity aimed at disseminating AI/ML tools for biomedical research. We work completely in the open, which means that we expect to publish and publicize the code developed during the project.

#### Responsibilities&#x20;

* Bring existing AI/ML models to production, ideally through an interoperable format such as ONNX.&#x20;
* Build a prototype for deploying those models to the AWS Cloud.&#x20;
* Precalculate predictions for a relevant subset of the models and migrate these predictions to the AWS Open Data Registry.&#x20;
* Develop a privacy-preserving pipeline to couple to automated AI/ML model training.&#x20;
* Retrain existing AI/ML models using a privacy-preserving framework.

#### **Qualifications**

* A master’s-level background in computer science or equivalent experience.&#x20;
* 2+ years of experience with data and AI/ML workflows.&#x20;
* Experience with Python and Jupyter Notebooks.&#x20;
* Experience with Docker containers and Conda environments.&#x20;
* Exposure to high-performance computing and GPUs is a plus.&#x20;
* Experience with AWS infrastructure is a plus.

#### **Details of the position**

* This position is fully remote. You will work with collaborators at the Central European Time zone, so availability to meet during CET working hours is required. Our partners are distributed across Africa, Europe and the UK.&#x20;
* EOSI will provide the necessary infrastructure to perform computations, including one workstation (including a RTX 3090 GPU)
* EOSI is mainly composed of volunteers, you will be welcome to join our Slack workspace and learn about the ongoing research at EOSI.
* International applicants are welcome to apply. Candidates should already be able to work legally where they are based, we can not offer visa support for this position at this time.
